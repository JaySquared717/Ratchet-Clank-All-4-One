He is an intergalactic hero, a skilled mechanic, and one of the last remaining lombaxes in the universe.</p><br><br>
                      <p class="characthers text-bg-light p-3 text-center">With (notorious intergallactic villian) Dr. Nefarious still on the loose, Ratchet claimed in an interview with Kip Darling and Pepper Fairbanks that he would not join the search, suggesting he had confidence in Qwark's ability. Later, Ratchet along with Clank followed Qwark to Luminopolis on Igliak, where he was supposed to receive an "Intergalactic Tool of Justice" award for defeating a Light-Eating Z'Grute, suspicious as Qwark had never done this. When arriving, Dr. Nefarious and his butler Lawrence appeared, and Nefarious resurrected a Light-Eating Z'Grute to kill them all, though he had no control over it and it instead ravaged the city. When Lawrence fled, announcing his resignation to Nefarious, Nefarious was forced to team up with Ratchet, Clank and Qwark to defeat it, though they were afterwards teleported away by a machine known as the Ephemeris to a testing laboratory on planet Magnus.</p>
