          Unlike previous games in the series which were mostly single-player-only games, All 4 One focuses on a four-player cooperative multiplayer mode which allows for drop-in and drop-out online as well as offline multiplayer. Players can each take the role of one of the four main characters of the game, namely Ratchet, Clank, Qwark and Doctor Nefarious.

          All 4 One adds a four-player drop-in drop-out co-op system to the classic Ratchet & Clank formula. The four players can be local, through the use of multiple controllers; online players, through the use of PlayStation Network; or, in the case of a single player, one AI character controlled by the CPU.

          Before the game was released, fan reception was mixed, with the major complaint being the focus of four-player co-op. All 4 One received polarized reviews, with a Metacritic score of 70/100 indicating "mixed or average reviews". IGN gave the game an 8/10 citing as a step backwards from A Crack in Time. The most negative review has come from Destructoid who gave the game 4/10 and said "Ratchet & Clank: All 4 One should have been about $15, five hours shorter, and released on the PlayStation Network. It's a game that does a disservice to the high pedigree of the Ratchet & Clank series and takes too far a departure from what made such an excellent series". GameSpot gave the game a 7 out of 10. Game Informer gave it an 8.75 out 10, saying "This Is One For All The Fans Of Co-op Platforming." Morgan Webb of X-Play gave the game a 3 out of 5, praising the variety, story, and saying it will keep fans satisfied for the next game, but criticizing the glitches, easy puzzles, and more kid-friendly tone.
